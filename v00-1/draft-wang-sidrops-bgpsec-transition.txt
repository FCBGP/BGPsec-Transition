                  Transition to Full BGPsec Deployment
              draft-wang-sidrops-bgpsec-transition-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a means to facilitate the deployment of
   BGPsec.  It modifies the BGPsec_PATH attribute to a transitive
   attribute and then addresses some problems brought by this change.
   It still aims to attest that every AS within the sequence of ASes
   enumerated in the UPDATE message has explicitly authorized the
   advertisement of the route.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] lacks inherent security
   mechanisms, especially for its Autonomous Systems (ASes) path and
   origin prefix information, making it vulnerable to route leaks and
   hijackings.

   BGPsec, defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to enhance security for AS
   path information.  However, it employs an optional non-transitive BGP
   path attribute to carry digital signatures, complicating incremental
   deployment.

   This document aims to facilitate the deployment of BGPsec.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Gap Analysis

   Traditional BGPsec is hard to achieve incremental deployment.  This
   document mainly focuses on making BGPsec incrementally deployable.

   It has at least two barriers to make BGPsec become transitive BGPsec.
   In the OPEN phase, BGPsec requires two BGPsec peers to negotiate
   BGPsec capability and multiprotocol capability.  In the UPDATE phase,
   the BGPsec_Path attribute is a non-transitive attribute.

   This document renders BGPsec transitive to facilitate the deployment
   of BGPsec.
