1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] is deficient in intrinsic
   security mechanisms, particularly regarding the Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) path information and origin prefix information.  As a result,
   it is susceptible to route leaks and hijackings.

   Native BGPsec, as defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to fortify the
   security of AS path information.  Nevertheless, native BGPsec
   encounters challenges in achieving incremental deployment.  It
   utilizes an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute to convey
   digital signatures, thereby complicating incremental deployment.

   The principal objectives are to make BGPsec incrementally deployable
   and transit transparently over BGPsec-unemployed areas.

   There are at least two obstacles to transforming BGPsec into
   transitive BGPsec.  During the OPEN phase, BGPsec necessitates that
   two BGPsec peers engage in the negotiation of BGPsec capability and
   multiprotocol capability.  In the UPDATE phase, the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute, being non-transitive, cannot traverse transparently across
   the legacy BGP area.

   In order to transit across areas where BGPsec has not been deployed,
   the most straightforward approach is to transform the native BGPsec
   into transitive BGPsec.  However, this document will illustrate that
   it is unfeasible to render BGPsec as a transitive approach for
   traversing undeployment areas while still using BGPsec_PATH type code
   in BGP UPDATE and maintaining compatibility with native BGPsec.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   BGP:  BGP, native BGP, and/or legacy BGP are the BGP version 4
      defined in [RFC4271] and/or multiprotocol BGP defined in
      [RFC4760].  It does not support BGPsec or native BGPsec.

   BGPsec:  BGPsec, native BGPsec, and/or traditional BGPsec are the
      BGPsec approach defined in [RFC8205].

   T-BGPsec:  T-BGPsec or transitive BGPsec means that the transitive
      BGPsec approach is defined in this document.

2.  Transitive BGPsec Modifications

   Transitive BGPsec, in essence, describes that the BGPsec_PATh must be
   transitive and compliant with native BGPsec.

2.1.  Transitive BGPsec Negotiation

   As stipulated in Section 2.2 of [RFC8205], for a BGPsec router to
   successfully negotiate with its peer, it must transmit the BGPsec
   Capabilities that are in accordance with those of its peers in the
   BGP OPEN message.  However, the transitive path attribute does not
   require the negotiation of capabilities with peers.  In the event
   that a peer fails to comprehend the transitive path attribute, it
   merely forwards it to downstream BGP speakers.

   In transitive BGPsec, there is no requirement to negotiate the BGPsec
   capability.  However, a BGPsec router is still obligated to inform
   its peer that it has support for transitive BGPsec.  In this
   scenario, the reuse of the BGPsec capability is essential.
   Nevertheless, there is no requirement to utilize the Dir field and
   the AFI field.  Transitive BGPsec reuses the native BGPsec capability
   format.  Consequently, the version field of the BGPsec capability
   must be updated to 1, while the remaining fields should be filled
   with 0.

   If a BGPsec router negotiates with its peers and the version value of
   the BGPsec capability is set to 1, this implies that the router
   supports transitive BGPsec.  In this scenario, the BGPsec capability
   serves two purposes.  Firstly, it notifies the peer that this
   particular BGP speaker is capable of supporting transitive BGPsec.
   Secondly, it differentiates transitive BGPsec from native BGPsec to
   ensure compatibility.

   For the sake of compatibility, this document designates that it still
   supports native BGPsec in this version.

2.2.  The Transitive BGPsec_PATH Attribute

   Given that the objective is to expedite the deployment of BGPsec,
   this document will effectuate the least possible modifications to
   BGPsec.  Consequently, all of the packet formats of the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute defined in [RFC8205] are reutilized in the establishment of
   transitive BGPsec, including the BGPsec_PATH attribute format,
   Secure_Path format, Secure_Path Segment format, Signature_Block
   format, and Signature_Block Segment format.

   In native BGPsec, the BGPsec_PATH attribute is an optional non-
   transitive BGP path attribute.  However, within this document, the
   BGPsec_PATH attribute is defined as an optional transitive BGP path
   attribute.  It is important to note that the attribute code should
   remain the same as that of the native BGPsec_PATH attribute.

2.3.  Updating and Receiving BGP UPDATE message

   TBD.

3.  Question: Compatibility with Native BGPsec

   Taking the topology presented in Figure 1 as an example: - AS A, AS
   B, and AS C are regions with continuous native BGPsec deployments.
   Specifically, AS A, AS B, and AS C implement native BGPsec.
   Additionally, AS C also implements transitive BGPsec. - AS D and AS E
   are areas with legacy BGP deployments.  These areas do not implement
   native BGPsec, transitive BGPsec, or any other related security
   mechanisms. - AS F and AS G are areas where either BGPsec or
   transitive BGPsec can be deployed.  That is to say, they have the
   option to implement either native BGPsec or transitive BGPsec.

   |                       |     |             |     |             |
   \                       /     \             /     \             /
    BGPsec Continuous Area      Non-BGPsec Area      (T-)BGPsec Area

                 Figure 1: Example: Mix Deployment Scenario

   AS A is capable of negotiating the BGPsec Capability with AS B.  AS A
   disseminates a route prefix through a BGPsec UPDATE message to AS B.

   AS B has the ability to negotiate the BGPsec Capability independently
   with both AS A and AS C.  It receives the BGPsec UPDATE message from
   AS A and validates it in accordance with native BGPsec.
   Subsequently, it modifies the BGPsec UPDATE message by incorporating
   its own information and forwards it to AS C.

   AS C obtains the BGPsec UPDATE message from AS B.  AS C validates the
   BGPsec UPDATE message and makes the necessary modifications.  In this
   scenario, AS C and AS D are unable to negotiate the BGPsec
   Capability.  Consequently, AS C converts this message into a
   transitive BGPsec UPDATE message.

   AS D and AS E refrain from processing this transitive BGPsec message
   and instead forward it to the subsequent hop.

   AS F receives this transitive BGPsec UPDATE message from AS E.

   In the event that AS F implements transitive BGPsec while AS G only
   deploys native BGPsec, AS F can downgrade the transitive BGPsec
   message to a legacy BGP message to ensure compatibility.

   When both AS F and AS G deploy native BGPsec, AS G will conduct a
   syntax check, which will fail due to the transitive nature of the
   transit bit.  In this situation, the BGPsec is deemed invalid.  Here,
   it is inferior to Legacy BGP in the context of BGP route selection.
   It remains an undefined behavior as to whether AS H should include
   the transitive BGPsec_PATH when propagating to downstream autonomous
   systems.

   It is not possible to ensure that there are no native BGPsec areas
   subsequent to Transitive BGPsec nodes.

   Consequently, transitive BGPsec is not a viable option.  There is a
   requirement for a new optional transitive path attribute.
