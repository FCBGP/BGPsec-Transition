Transition to Full BGPsec Deployment: Transitive-BGPsec is Incompatible
                              with BGPsec
              draft-wang-sidrops-bgpsec-transition-latest

Abstract

   This document elaborates on the reasons why it is unfeasible to
   reconstruct the native-BGPsec as a transitive approach, such that a
   BGP update with a correctly signed BGPsec_PATH attribute can traverse
   legacy areas and afterwards it can still be properly processed by
   subsequent native-BGPsec speakers.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] is vulnerable to route
   leaks and hijacking attacks.

   Native BGPsec, as defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to enhance the
   security of AS path information.  Nevertheless, native BGPsec
   encounters challenges in achieving incremental deployment.  It
   utilizes an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute to deliver
   digital signatures.  Yet, when BGPsec messages traverse BGPsec-
   unemployed, the last BGPsec-aware router falls back to native BGP
   protocol to ensure backward compatibility, by completely removing the
   BGPsec-related path attribute (i.e., the BGPsec_PATH attribute).

   The principal objectives are to make BGPsec transit transparently
   over BGPsec-unemployed areas, instead of completely falling back to
   legacy BGP.

   In order to transit across areas where BGPsec has not been deployed,
   the most straightforward approach is to transform the native BGPsec
   into transitive BGPsec.  However, this document will illustrate that
   it is unfeasible to render BGPsec as a transitive approach for
   traversing undeployed areas while still being compatible with native
   BGPsec.  In other words, transitive BGPsec is not compatible with
   BGPsec.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   BGP:  BGP, native BGP, and/or legacy BGP are the BGP version 4
      defined in [RFC4271] and/or multiprotocol BGP defined in
      [RFC4760].  It does not support BGPsec or native BGPsec.

   BGPsec:  BGPsec, native BGPsec, and/or traditional BGPsec are the
      BGPsec approach defined in [RFC8205].

   T-BGPsec:  T-BGPsec or transitive BGPsec means that the transitive
      BGPsec approach is defined in this document.

2.  Transitive BGPsec Modifications

   Transitive BGPsec, in essence, describes that the BGPsec_PATh must be
   transitive and compliant with native BGPsec.

2.1.  Transitive BGPsec Negotiation

   As stated in Section 2.2 of [RFC8205], for a BGPsec router to
   successfully negotiate with its peer, it must transmit the BGPsec
   Capabilities that are in accordance with those of its peers in the
   BGP OPEN message.  A transitive path attribute, instead, does not
   require the negotiation of capabilities with peers.  In the event
   that a peer fails to comprehend the transitive path attribute, it
   simply forwards it to downstream BGP speakers.

   In transitive BGPsec, negotiating the BGPsec capability is not
   required.  However, a BGPsec router is obligated to inform its peer
   that it supports transitive BGPsec.  In this case, the reuse of the
   BGPsec capability is essential.  Nevertheless, there is no
   requirement to utilize the Dir field and the AFI field.  Transitive
   BGPsec reuses the native BGPsec capability format.  Consequently, the
   version field of the BGPsec capability must be updated to 1, while
   the remaining fields should be filled with 0.

   If a BGPsec router negotiates with its peers and the version value of
   the BGPsec capability is set to 1, this implies that the router
   supports transitive BGPsec.  In this scenario, the BGPsec capability
   serves two purposes.  Firstly, it notifies the peer that this
   particular BGP speaker is capable of supporting transitive BGPsec.
   Secondly, it differentiates transitive BGPsec from native BGPsec.

   For the sake of compatibility, this document designates that it still
   supports native BGPsec in this version.

2.2.  The Transitive BGPsec_PATH Attribute

   Given that the objective is to expedite the incremental deployment of
   BGPsec, this document considers the least possible modifications to
   BGPsec.  Consequently, all of the packet formats of the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute defined in [RFC8205] are reutilized in the establishment of
   transitive BGPsec, including the BGPsec_PATH attribute format,
   Secure_Path format, Secure_Path Segment format, Signature_Block
   format, and Signature_Block Segment format.

   In native BGPsec, the BGPsec_PATH attribute is an optional non-
   transitive BGP path attribute.  However, within this document, the
   BGPsec_PATH attribute is defined as an optional transitive BGP path
   attribute.  It is important to note that the attribute code should
   remain the same as that of the native BGPsec_PATH attribute.

2.3.  Updating and Receiving BGP UPDATE message

   TBD.

3.  Question: Compatibility with Native BGPsec

   Taking the topology presented in Figure 1 as an example: - AS A, AS
   B, and AS C are regions with continuous native BGPsec deployments.
   Specifically, AS A, AS B, and AS C implement native BGPsec.
   Additionally, AS C also implements transitive BGPsec. - AS D and AS E
   are areas with legacy BGP deployments.  These areas do not implement
   native BGPsec, transitive BGPsec, or any other related security
   mechanisms. - AS F deploys native BGPsec.

   +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+
   | A | --> | B | --> | C | --> | D | --> | E | --> | F | --> ...
   +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+
   |                       |     |             |       |
   |                       |     |             |       |
   \                       /     \             /       |
    BGPsec Continuous Area      Non-BGPsec Area      BGPsec/T-BGPsec

                 Figure 1: Example: Mix Deployment Scenario

   AS A is capable of negotiating the BGPsec Capability with AS B.  AS A
   disseminates a route prefix through a BGPsec UPDATE message to AS B.

   AS B can negotiate the BGPsec Capability independently with both AS A
   and AS C.  It receives the BGPsec UPDATE message from AS A and
   validates it in accordance with the BGPsec specification.
   Subsequently, it modifies the BGPsec UPDATE message by incorporating
   its own information and forwards it to AS C.

   AS C obtains the BGPsec UPDATE message from AS B.  AS C validates the
   BGPsec UPDATE message and makes the necessary modifications.  In this
   scenario, because AS D is a legacy AS, AS C converts this message
   into a transitive BGPsec UPDATE message.

   AS D and AS E refrain from processing this transitive BGPsec message
   and instead forward it to the subsequent hop.

   AS F receives this transitive BGPsec UPDATE message from AS E.
   Because AS F deploys the native BGPsec, it will conduct a syntax
   check.  However, the verification will fail because the message is
   not correctly formatted as a BGPsec UPDATE message.

   In summary, any native BGPsec speaker on the downstream of an
   undeployed region cannot properly process the transitive BGPsec
   UPDATE messages sent by upstream ASes.

   Thus, we conclude that the transitive BGPsec is a viable option to
   make BGPsec incrementally deployable.

   A new intermediate protocol is required in the transition to full
   BGPsec deployment.
