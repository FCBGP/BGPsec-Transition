                  Transition to Full BGPsec Deployment
              draft-wang-sidrops-bgpsec-transition-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a means to facilitate the deployment of
   BGPsec.  It modifies the non-transitive BGPsec_PATH attribute to a
   transitive BGPsec_PATH attribute and addresses some problems this
   modification brings.  It still aims to attest that every AS within
   the sequence of ASes enumerated in the UPDATE message has explicitly
   authorized the advertisement of the route.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] is deficient in intrinsic
   security mechanisms, particularly regarding the Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) path information and origin prefix information.  As a result,
   it is susceptible to route leaks and hijackings.

   Traditional BGPsec, as defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to fortify
   the security of AS path information.  Nevertheless, traditional
   BGPsec encounters challenges in achieving incremental deployment.  It
   utilizes an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute to convey
   digital signatures, thereby complicating incremental deployment.

   The principal objective of this document is to make BGPsec
   incrementally deployable.  Driven by this aim, it modifies the
   traditional BGPsec into transitive BGPsec.

   There exist at least two obstacles to transforming BGPsec into
   transitive BGPsec.  During the OPEN phase, BGPsec necessitates that
   two BGPsec peers engage in the negotiation of BGPsec capability and
   multiprotocol capability.  In the UPDATE phase, the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute, being non-transitive, cannot traverse transparently across
   the legacy BGP area.

   The objective of this document is to facilitate the deployment of
   BGPsec.  This document modifies the non-transitive BGPsec_PATH into
   the transitive BGPsec_PATH and addresses the issues arising from this
   modification.
