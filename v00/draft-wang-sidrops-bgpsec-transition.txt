1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] lacks inherent security
   mechanisms, especially for its Autonomous Systems (ASes) path and
   origin prefix information, making it vulnerable to route leaks and
   hijackings.

   BGPsec, defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to enhance security for AS
   path information.  However, it employs an optional non-transitive BGP
   path attribute to carry digital signatures, complicating incremental
   deployment.

   This document aims to facilitate the deployment of BGPsec.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Problem Statements

   The global adoption of BGPsec faces significant barriers rooted in
   technical incompatibilities, operational complexities, and
   coordination dependencies.  We have summaried them as follows.

   1.  BGPsec requires explicit capability negotiation between peering
       routers during session establishment.  If either peer lacks
       BGPsec support, the protocol defaults to legacy BGP operation,
       creating fragmented security coverage in heterogeneous network
       environments.  Thus, when an AS wants to deploy BGPsec, it must
       require its peers to also implement and deploy BGPsec.
       Otherwise, BGPsec will downgrade to traditional BGP and cannot
       transit transparently over legacy BGP areas.

   1.  The BGPsec_Path attribute replaces AS_PATH/AS4_PATH with
       cryptographically signed routing data.  No graceful degradation
       mechanism exists for mixed BGPsec-legacy paths.  Critical path
       attributes may be stripped or misinterpreted when traversing
       legacy nodes, potentially violating routing integrity.

   1.  The reliance of legacy systems on AS path information for
       critical functions (e.g., loop prevention, route prioritization)
       creates operational hazards when BGPsec_Path is uninterpreted.
       This may result in suboptimal path selection or unintended
       traffic blackholing.

   1.  End-to-end security guarantees are contingent on full-path BGPsec
       adoption.  Partial deployment leaves unsigned AS-path segments
       vulnerable to forgery, creating a "weakest link" security model
       that undermines incentives for early adopters.

   1.  Cryptographic signing/validation of updates at each AS hop
       imposes substantial processing overhead, necessitating hardware
       upgrades and optimized signing algorithms for large-scale
       deployments.

   1.  BGPsec requires the establishment of a globally trusted Public
       Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate issuance, revocation,
       and lifecycle management.  Maintaining this PKI at internet-scale
       demands unprecedented cross-organizational coordination.

   1.  The protocol's security value is realized only through near-
       universal adoption, yet achieving consensus among autonomous
       network operators with divergent priorities remains a systemic
       challenge.

   This document mainly focuses on the technical incompatibilities to
   make BGPsec incrementally deployable.
