                  Transition to Full BGPsec Deployment
              draft-wang-sidrops-bgpsec-transition-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a means to facilitate the deployment of
   BGPsec.  It modifies the non-transitive BGPsec_PATH attribute to a
   transitive BGPsec_PATH attribute and addresses some problems this
   modification brings.  It still aims to attest that every AS within
   the sequence of ASes enumerated in the UPDATE message has explicitly
   authorized the advertisement of the route.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] is deficient in intrinsic
   security mechanisms, particularly regarding the Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) path information and origin prefix information.  As a result,
   it is susceptible to route leaks and hijackings.

   Traditional BGPsec, as defined in [RFC8205], extends BGP to fortify
   the security of AS path information.  Nevertheless, traditional
   BGPsec encounters challenges in achieving incremental deployment.  It
   utilizes an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute to convey
   digital signatures, thereby complicating incremental deployment.

   The principal objective of this document is to make BGPsec
   incrementally deployable.  Driven by this aim, it modifies the
   traditional BGPsec into transitive BGPsec.

   There exist at least two obstacles to transforming BGPsec into
   transitive BGPsec.  During the OPEN phase, BGPsec necessitates that
   two BGPsec peers engage in the negotiation of BGPsec capability and
   multiprotocol capability.  In the UPDATE phase, the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute, being non-transitive, cannot traverse transparently across
   the legacy BGP area.

   The objective of this document is to facilitate the deployment of
   BGPsec with as minimal modifications as possible.  This document
   modifies the non-transitive BGPsec_PATH into the transitive
   BGPsec_PATH and addresses the issues arising from this modification.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   BGP:  BGP, native BGP, and/or legacy BGP are the BGP version 4
      defined in [RFC4271] and/or multiprotocol BGP defined in
      [RFC4760].  It does not support BGPsec or traditional BGPsec.

   BGPsec:  BGPsec, native BGPsec, and/or traditional BGPsec are the
      BGPsec approach defined in [RFC8205].

   T-BGPsec:  T-BGPsec or transitive BGPsec means that the transitive
      BGPsec approach is defined in this document.

2.  BGPsec Negotiation

   As stipulated in Section 2.2 of [RFC8205], for a BGPsec router to
   successfully negotiate with its peer, it must transmit the BGPsec
   Capabilities that are in accordance with those of its peers in the
   BGP OPEN message.  However, the transitive path attribute does not
   require the negotiation of capabilities with peers.  In the event
   that a peer fails to comprehend the transitive path attribute, it
   merely forwards it to downstream BGP speakers.

   In transitive BGPsec, there is no requirement to negotiate the BGPsec
   capability.  However, a BGPsec router is still obligated to inform
   its peer that it has support for transitive BGPsec.  In this
   scenario, the reuse of the BGPsec capability is essential.
   Nevertheless, there is no requirement to utilize the Dir field and
   the AFI field.  Transitive BGPsec reuses the traditional BGPsec
   capability format.  Consequently, the version field of the BGPsec
   capability must be updated to 1, while the remaining fields should be
   filled with 0.

   If a BGPsec router negotiates with its peers and the version value of
   the BGPsec capability is set to 1, this implies that the router
   supports transitive BGPsec.  In this scenario, the BGPsec capability
   serves two purposes.  Firstly, it notifies the peer that this
   particular BGP speaker is capable of supporting transitive BGPsec.
   Secondly, it differentiates transitive BGPsec from traditional BGPsec
   to ensure compatibility.

   For the sake of compatibility, this document designates that it still
   supports traditional BGPsec in this version.

3.  The BGPsec_PATH Attribute

   Given that the objective is to expedite the deployment of BGPsec,
   this document will effectuate the least possible modifications to
   BGPsec.  Consequently, all of the packet formats of the BGPsec_PATH
   attribute defined in [RFC8205] are reutilized in the establishment of
   transitive BGPsec, including the BGPsec_PATH attribute format,
   Secure_Path format, Secure_Path Segment format, Signature_Block
   format, and Signature_Block Segment format.

   In traditional BGPsec, the BGPsec_PATH attribute is an optional non-
   transitive BGP path attribute.  However, within this document, the
   BGPsec_PATH attribute is defined as an optional transitive BGP path
   attribute.  It is important to note that the attribute code should
   remain the same as that of the traditional BGPsec_PATH attribute.

4.  BGPsec UPDATE Messages

4.1.  General Guidance

   Transitive BGPsec obeys the traditional BGPsec rules except that the
   AS_PATH is mutually exclusive with the BGPsec_PATH attribute.

   The AS_PATH is a mandatory path attribute in the legacy BGP UPDATE
   message.  It is of fundamental importance to achieve transparent
   traversal of legacy BGP.  In the event that the subsequent BGP
   speakers do not support BGPsec, the traditional BGPsec will revert to
   BGP.  Moreover, it will restore the AS_PATH from the BGPsec_PATH.

   The AS_PATH attribute is retained in transitive BGPsec; both the
   AS_PATH and BGPsec_PATH attributes will co-exist within the BGP
   UPDATE message.  It will simplify the operations requiring the
   AS_PATH attribute and transparently transit over legacy BGP speakers.
   The processing of AS_PATH is the same as in the legacy BGP.

   The AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET have been deprecated in [RFC9774] in
   BGP, so transitive BGPsec would not consider this scenario where
   AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET co-exists with the BGPsec_PATH attribute.

4.2.  Constructing the Transitive BGPsec_PATH Attribute

   The generation of the transitive BGPsec_PATH attribute is similar to
   traditional BGPsec.  The transit bit is set as transitive to render
   this attribute as a transitive path attribute.

   If the ASes in the BGPsec_PATH attribute are the same as those in the
   AS_PATH attribute, i.e., the BGPsec_PATH is complete, the signature
   generation follows the traditional BGPsec.  Otherwise, in the
   BGPsec_PATH broken case, where some BGP speakers don't support
   transitive BGPsec, the digital signature is computed as follows:

   *  In order to construct the digital signature for Signature Segment
      N (that is produced by the current AS), first construct the
      sequence of octets to be hashed as shown in Figure 1.  This
      sequence of octets includes all the data that the Nth AS attests
      to by adding its digital signature in the UPDATE message that is
      being forwarded to a BGPsec speaker in the (N+1)th AS.

   *  The elements in this sequence MUST be ordered exactly as shown in
      Figure 1.  The 'Target AS Number' is the AS to whom the transitive
      BGPsec speaker intends to send the UPDATE message.  (Note that the
      'Target AS Number' is the AS number announced by the peer in the
      OPEN message of the BGP session within which the UPDATE message is
      sent.)  The Secure_Path Segment N is obtained from the BGPsec_PATH
      attribute.  The Previous AS Number N-1 is obtained from the
      AS_PATH attribute, which is the AS number of the previous hop.
      Finally, the Address Family Identifier (AFI), Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), and NLRI fields are obtained from the
      MP_REACH_NLRI attribute [RFC4760].  Additionally, in the Prefix
      field within the NLRI field (see Section 5 of [RFC4760]), all of
      the trailing bits MUST be set to 0 when constructing this
      sequence.

   *  Apply to this octet sequence (in Figure 1) the digest algorithm
      (for the algorithm suite of this Signature_Block) to obtain a
      digest value.

   *  Apply to this digest value the signature algorithm (for the
      algorithm suite of this Signature_Block) to obtain the digital
      signature.

4.3.  Processing Instructions for Confederation Members

   It is REQUIRED NOT to utilize the transitive BGPsec approach within
   AS confederations.  In other words, within an AS confederation, it
   MUST employ legacy BGP.

5.  Processing a Received Transitive BGPsec UPDATE Message

   Transitive BGPsec also obeys most of the traditional BGPsec rules in
   processing a received transitive BGPsec UPDATE message.

   Unless the BGPsec_PATH is broken and the corresponding BGPsec
   signature is missing, a BGPsec speaker MUST utilize the AS path
   information in the Secure_Path in most cases, as many as possible,
   where it would otherwise use the AS path information in the AS_PATH
   attribute.
